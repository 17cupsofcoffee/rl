This is a simple (and extremely work-in-progress) roguelike, written in Rust.
It uses:

* [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/Tetra) - rendering/input/windowing/etc
* [Specs](https://github.com/slide-rs/specs) - ECS

## Building

To build this project, you'll need the SDL2 development libraries set up on your machine. Instructions can be found [on Tetra's website](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/installation).
