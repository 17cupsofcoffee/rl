[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/17cupsofcoffee/rl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/17cupsofcoffee/rl)

This is a simple (and extremely work-in-progress) roguelike, written in Rust.
It uses:

* [GGEZ](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/) - rendering/input/windowing/etc
* [specs](https://github.com/slide-rs/specs) - ECS

## Building
To build this project, you'll need the SDL2 development libraries set up on your machine. A good set of instructions can be found [in the SDL2 crate's readme](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries).
